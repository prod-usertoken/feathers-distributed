> Distribute your Feathers services as microservices

** Patched to support [portfinder](https://github.com/prod-usertoken/node-portfinder) highestPort crash

**This plugin is under development and currently in beta-test, updates will be pushed frequently.
As a consequence it should be considered unstable, not yet ready for production use.
Although we try to avoid this wherever possible, `0.x` versions on the master branch can promote breaking changes in the API.**

The [`master`](https://github.com/kalisio/feathers-distributed) branch and 0.3.x version is expected to work with [Feathers v3](https://buzzard.docs.feathersjs.com/) (a.k.a. Buzzard).
The [`auk`](https://github.com/kalisio/feathers-distributed/tree/auk) branch and 0.2.x version is expected to work with [Feathers v2](https://auk.docs.feathersjs.com/) (a.k.a. Auk).

This plugin relies on [cote](https://github.com/dashersw/cote) and takes benefits of it:
- **Zero-configuration:** no IP addresses, no ports, no routing to configure
- **Decentralized:** No fixed parts, no "manager" nodes, no single point of
                     failure
- **Auto-discovery:** Services discover each other without a central bookkeeper
- **Fault-tolerant:** Don't lose any requests when a service is down
- **Scalable:** Horizontally scale to any number of machines
- **Performant:** Process thousands of messages per second

**cote** requires your cloud provider to support IP broadcast or multicast. You can still have the same functionality
with [Weave overlay networks](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave), eg on Docker's Cloud. In any other cases you can use [centralized discovery](https://github.com/dashersw/cote#using-centralized-discovery-tools).

> cote works out of the box with Docker Swarm and Docker Cloud but we are seeking for volunteers to test this module under various Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, etc. Please open an issue if you'd like to do so and report your findings.

You might find this [presentation](http://slides.com/armaganamcalar/apiconf-zero-conf-microservices#/) really helpful to understand it.

## Installation

```
npm install @kalisio/feathers-distributed --save
```

**To get the latest version please use the following command:**
```
npm install https://github.com/kalisio/feathers-distributed --save
```

`feathers-distributed` is as least intrusive as possible so for most use cases you simply need to configure it along with your applications holding your services:
```javascript
const distribution = require('@kalisio/feathers-distributed');
...
app.configure(hooks());
app.configure(socketio());
app.configure(distribution());
...
```

## Documentation

![Microservice architecture](https://cdn.rawgit.com/kalisio/feathers-distributed/dd436d9e1a70b66607a893ba9efeaeab339fd50e/Architecture%20Diagram.svg)

When the plugin initializes the following is done for your app:
* creates a [publisher](https://github.com/dashersw/cote#creating-a-publisher) to dispatch its *locally registered services* to other nodes. 
* creates a [subscriber](https://github.com/dashersw/cote#creating-a-subscriber) to be aware of *remotely registered services* from other nodes. 

What is done by overriding `app.use` is the following: 
* each *local* Feathers service of your app creates a [responder](https://github.com/dashersw/cote#creating-a-responder) to handle incoming requests from other nodes.
* each *local* Feathers service of your app creates a [publisher](https://github.com/dashersw/cote#creating-a-publisher) to dispatch service-level events to other nodes.

What is done when your app is aware of a new remotely registered service is the following: 
* creates a local Feathers service *acting as a proxy* to the remote one by creating a [requester](https://github.com/dashersw/cote#creating-a-requester) to send incoming requests to other nodes.
* this proxy service also creates a [subscriber](https://github.com/dashersw/cote#creating-a-subscriber) to be aware of service-level events coming from other nodes.

## Example

To launch the example:
```
npm start
```
Wait a couple of seconds so that each app is aware of other apps on the network. Open the *example/index.html* file in your browser, you should see a TODO coming from a microservice.

Look for details into the [example folder](./example).

## Authentication

There are two scenarios:
* the **API gateway**, where you have a single entry point (ie node) to authenticate and access your API but services are distributed accross different nodes
* the **distributed application**, where you can distribute and access any service on any node on your network mesh with authentication

### API gateway: 

In this case you have to [install the authentication plugin](https://auk.docs.feathersjs.com/api/authentication/server.html#authentication) on your gateway and register a hook that will enforce authentication on each registered remote service by using the `hooks` option:
```
app.configure(
  distribution({
    hooks: {
      before: {
        all: [authenticate('jwt')],
      },
    },
  })
);
```
You don't need to install the authentication plugin or hook on each service served from your nodes.

You process as usual to [authenticate your client](https://auk.docs.feathersjs.com/api/authentication/client.html#additional-feathersclient-methods) first on the gateway with a local or JWT strategy for instance.

Our [example folder](./example) is a good start for this use case.

### Distributed application

In this case you have to [install the authentication plugin](https://auk.docs.feathersjs.com/api/authentication/server.html#authentication) on each of your nodes and register a hook that will enforce authentication on each service as usual.

You process as usual to [authenticate your client](https://auk.docs.feathersjs.com/api/authentication/client.html#additional-feathersclient-methods) first on any node with a local or JWT strategy for instance.

Our [tests](https://github.com/kalisio/feathers-distributed/blob/master/test/index.test.js) contain a good example for this use case.

> To make it work all nodes must share the same authentication configuration (i.e. secret)
